// in the first step i have implemented the authentication 

// in the second step  need to implement 
-- convert the currency
-- history of the currency -- need to create a  schema so the user have different currency converters
-- users should also save the favorite currency pairs
-- users should also   get the favorite currency pairs 

// for fetching the currency conversion and the rates 
-- the main problem is the currency rate like dollar is not constant so as to be compared with all the other  countries
-- so we require an api which provide us the current conversion rate 
-- thinking of using the third party api which can give the  conversion rate based on the country
-- if the user want the reverse conversion we can let the user to change in the frontend based on that we can hit the currency conversion route


// currently in the backend after hitting the currency conversion 
-- i will expect the response as 
 -- from 
 -- to 
 -- amount (which the user has given)
 -- converted_amount(conversion converted_amount)
